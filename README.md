## Hi everyone 👋

I'm a computer systems engineering student 🤓. Also, I´m president of WIE at IEEE - UPB 📚, secretary of technology and innovation at SEUPB 💜💛 and departmental director of web media at Mujeres TIC La Paz 💻

I like to learn about new topics, especially about new programming languages or new functionalities on them. ❣️

Some of the languages and frameworks I work with are:

- _Java._
- _C++._
- _Python._
- _Kotlin._
- _Scala._
- _MYSQL._
- _Angular._
